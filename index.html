          <h2>Dexter "Buddy Bear" Dog</h2>
          <p>Dexter was the first dog I could call my own. I had always dreamed of owning a golden retriever, so when Dexter came into my life, it was like a dream come true. We were like father and son, and could do no wrong in each others' eyes.</p>

          <h2>Clementine "Tiny" Dog</h2>
          <p>A rescue intended to replace a cherished friend, Clementine chose ours to be her "fur-ever" home instead of the one she was chosen for. Neurotic and ferocious, we needed to earn her trust before we knew how much love she had to offer.</p>

          <h2>Unconditional Love</h2>
