          <h2 class="section-title">Dexter "Buddy Bear" Dog</h2>
          <p>Dexter was the first dog I could call my own. I had always dreamed of owning a golden retriever, so when Dexter came into my life, it was like a dream come true. We were like father and son, and could do no wrong in each others' eyes. As a working class golden rather than a show golden, his unique pedigree was readily apparent in his appearance and demeanor, his flat coat and deep golden color often confusing him with an irish setter. His calm, affable nature and unusual appearance made him an instant celebrity wherever we would go.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Clementine "Tiny" Dog</h2>
          <p>A rescue intended to replace a cherished friend, Clementine chose ours to be her "fur-ever" home instead of the one she was chosen for. Neurotic and ferocious, we needed to earn her trust before we knew how much love she had to offer. A whippet crossed with a Jack Russell terrier, Clementine was originally bred by an illegal poaching ring in Missouri. When the puppy mill was raided, she escaped from animal control and lived on her own for a brief period of time. Eventually she would find her way to the shelter where we would adopt her, knowing nothing of her history. While she has presented a special challenge in her 7 years with us due to her fearful and aggressive nature, her limitless desire to learn how to please her new owners has earned her place in our pack.  </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Lincoln "Stinkin&apos;" Dog</h2>
          <p>Changing lives and changing life companions brought this little bundle of charm and bad breath into the family, effortlessly wriggling his way into everyone's hearts. Tragedy struck when his predecessor, a rare breed of long-haired dachshund named Ladybird, was taken before her time. Her memory would live on when Lincoln later joined us to become the ultimate lap dog and snuggle buddy, not only to his hoomans, but also to his new found canine companions.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">The Three Musketeers</h2>
          <p>Overcoming significant differences in age, size, temperament and life experience, Dexter, Tiny and Lincoln became fast friends, enjoying many adventures together. Turning heads wherever the went, Lincoln at 15 pounds and Tiny at 35 pounds together on their tandem leash with Dexter at 80 pounds strutting alongside, the three of them eager to share their joy with the world at large on endless car rides and camping trips.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">One Last Walk</h2>
          <p>Sadly, illness took Dexter from us much too soon. Beloved of everyone he met, the hole in our hearts can never be filled. Unfortunately, we learned too late that selective breeding of championship bloodlines shortened his lifespan, and he ultimately succumbed to kidney and liver failure at only 8 years old. </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Tiny and Stink</h2>
          <p>In the wake of Dexter's passing, Tiny and Lincoln embrace each other, becoming a dynamic duo. Sharing a social awkwardness early in life, their true personalities shined when they were together, as inseparable as they were adorable. Although they had each other, the loneliness felt at the loss of Dexter permeated our lives, and even these two suffered occasional bouts of sadness.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">A New Baby</h2>
          <p>Time passes and a new arrival comes, this time in a package befitting the size of the challenges she will present. A litter of puppies from a colleague and friend presented a unique opportunity to introduce a new friend to the family, a rare mix of Armenian Gampr and Khazakhstani Central Asian Shepherd landraces. As long-lived as they are big-boned, livestock guardian dogs have been natural protectors of their flocks and families for thousands of years. Named Hli&#769;na after the Icelandic word for "guardian", she truly was a giant, weighing nearly 30 pounds when she came to us at only 8 weeks old.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Hli&#769;na "Gomper" Dog</h2>
          <p>A natural guardian, Hli&#769;na all too quickly grows to establish her dominance over the pack and our hearts. At only 1 year old, she now weighed over 115 pounds, the obvious alpha leader of her new pack with some growing still to do. Occasionally clumsy and always hungry as she grows into her ever-enlarging body, she presented us and the littles with moments of doubt and trepidation, ultimately showing how she'd grown into our hearts as well as our house.</p>

          <p>In time, our wounds mend, the bond of family is reborn, and the Three Musketeers ride again.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Unconditional Love</h2>
          <p>Life teaches us that no love is without its share of trials and tribulations. Owning a dog means learning that the love you have to give will be unconditionally returned.</p>
